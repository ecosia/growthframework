Growth Framework for Engineering at Ecosia

The engineering growth framework defines our expectations for 25 competencies with the goal to incentivise the work and behavior we value, give a map of progress and career perspective and encourage growth of a diverse and inclusive team through fair and transparent standards. The framework was created with input from the engineering team.

The competencies are organized into the five areas of Building, Delivery, Collaboration, Leadership and Company Development. The expectations per competencies are defined for four levels of engineering growth: Junior Engineer, Engineer, Senior Engineer and Principal Engineer.

Each engineer's growth framework level is evaluated after the first six months and reevaluated annually through a combination of self-assessment, peer review and manager calibration.
